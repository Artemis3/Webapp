This is a basic web app that I have created following along to "Learning Web App Development" by Semmy Purewal.

I like Semmy's teaching style where he is not holding your hand constantly. He introduces key concepts and syntax and leads you through a couple examples and then he will task you with a list of things that you have to figure out based on what you just learned.
